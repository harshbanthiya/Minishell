Concepts of Job Control 

The fundamental purpose of interactive shell is 
    1 - to read commands from user terminal     
    2 - to create processes to execute the programs specified in those commands 
            (fork and exec)

A single command may run just one process but often one command uses several processes. 
If you use the '|' operator you request several programs in their own processes. But even if you run just the one program, it can use 
multiple processes internally. 

Like compilation uses 'cc -c foo.c' typically uses four processes. 

The processes belonging to a single command is called a "process group" or "job";
This is so that you can operate on all of them at once. 
cc -c sends signal SIGINT to terminate all processes in the foreground process group

A session is a larger group of processes. Normally all processes that stem from a single login belong to the same session.

Every process belongs to a process group,
    When a process is created, it becomes the member of the same process group and session as its parent process.
    We can put it in another process group using setpgid function, provided the process belongs to the same session
    The only way to put a process in a different session is to make it the initial process of a new session, using setsid function 

Important 

A shell that supports job control must arrange to control which job can use the terminal at the time. 
    Otherwise there might be multiple jobs trying to read from the terminal at once, and the confusion about which process should receive
    the input. To prevent the confusion, the shell must cooperate the terminal driver using the protocol described below 


The shell can give unlimited access to the controlling terminal to only one process group at a time. 
This is called a foreground job on that controlling terminal. Other process groups managed by the shell that are executing without the 
access to the terminal are called background jobs.


CONTROLLING TERMINAL OF A PROCESS 
____________________________

One of the attributes of a process is its controlling terminal. Child Processes created with fork() inherit the controlling terminal from
their parents. In this way, all the processes in a session inherit the controlling terminal from the session leader. A session leader that 
has control of a terminal is called the controlling process of that terminal.

____________________________

ACCESS to the controlling Terminal 

As we know the foreground processes have unrestricted access to that terminal; background processes do not. Whenever the background process
tried to read from the terminal, the process group is usually sent a SIGTTIN signal. This causes all the processes in that group to stop.
Same goes for SIGTTOU signal which is used to write to terminal. 


SUMMARY
____________________________

void init_shell (void)
Initialize the shellâ€™s internal state. See shell_init.c

void launch_job (job *j, int foreground)
Launch the job j as either a foreground or background job. See launching_jobs.c

void do_job_notification (void)
Check for and report any jobs that have terminated or stopped. 
Can be called synchronously or within a handler for SIGCHLD signals. See stopped_terminated_jobs.c

void continue_job (job *j, int foreground)
Continue the job j. See Continuing stopped_terminated_jobs.c

Of course, a real shell would also want to provide other functions for managing jobs. 
For example, it would be useful to have commands to list all active jobs or 
to send a signal (such as SIGKILL) to a job.
