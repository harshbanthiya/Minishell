BASH NOTES 

At its base, it is macro processor 
Interactive features include job control, command line editing, command history and aliases 

Definitions 
____________________________

Blank : space / tab 
builtin : implemented internally by the shell 

control operator: A token that performs a control function ( newline or || && & ; ;; ;& ;;& | |& ( ))
exit status: 

field: A unit of text that is the result of the shell expansion 
filename: string of chars used to identify a file 

job: A set of processes comprising of a pipeline, and any processe descended from it, that are all in the same process group
job control: A mechanism by which users can selectively stop(suspend) and restart(resume) execution of processes; 

A metacharacter: A character that when unquoted separates words. A space, tab, newline or any of these '|' '&' ';' '(' ')' '<' '>'

____________________________

A running program is called a process. 
A process has a number of File descriptors -- which are just numbers for identifying connections that are currently open to data sources
and that can be read and written. (Files/pipes)
This is what is passed to read and write system calls telling them where to read and write from. You get new fd when we open or make pipes

In order to create new processes, a process can use the fork() system call, this copies the whole process data including the Fds, it is also
running the same program and is at the same place in the execution of that program. 

Redirections 
When you redirect the input if a process with <, it is the STDIN descriptor that gets connected to a file instead of to the terminal 
when you redirect the output with >, the stdout is replaced. 
To do the replacing of stdin and stdout, you can use the dup2() system call, which makes a copy of an existing descriptor under a new number (which can be 0 or 1 to replace stdin or stdout). 
So you create a pipe, get two descriptors, and then ask dup2() to duplicate one of these descriptors as number 0 or 1, to make it replace stdin or stdout with one side of the pipe.
